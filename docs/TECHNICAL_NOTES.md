# AutoCommand — Technical Notes

How AutoCommand delivers what the [README](../README.md) promises: the technologies behind each capability, the design rules they follow, and every place on disk the app writes. No marketing — just what runs, what it touches, and why.

> **Note (v2026.10.22):** the consumer tabs (Quick Scan, Attack Surface, Bloatware, Telemetry, Privacy, Update Control, Tasks, Startup, Hibernation, OS Hardening, DBX Safety) moved to [Shields Up](https://github.com/dparksports/shields-up/releases/latest) and were removed from the UI. Sections below that describe those features cover services that remain in the codebase but currently have no tab in the app.

## Design rules

1. **Zero-PowerShell core.** Monitoring and mitigation talk to Windows directly — COM, WMI, and P/Invoke — never by spawning `powershell.exe`. Native command-line tools (`powercfg`, `bcdedit`, `schtasks`, `wevtutil`) are used only where Microsoft ships no COM or .NET surface, and always through one audited runner (`Helpers/ProcessRunner.cs`).
   *The one documented exception:* applying DBX updates uses the `Set-SecureBootUEFI` PowerShell cmdlet, because Microsoft provides no native C# API for UEFI Secure Boot variable writes.
2. **Nothing runs without you.** Bloatware removal, firewall profile applies, and DBX updates all confirm first.
3. **Non-removable means non-offered.** System-signed OS components are filtered out of the Default Apps list and are never offered by bloatware removal — by design, not by configuration.
4. **Verified downloads.** Auto-downloaded tools (Sysinternals `sigcheck64.exe`) must pass both a logged SHA256 check and a native `WinVerifyTrust` Authenticode verification; anything else is deleted, never executed.
5. **Plain, inspectable state.** User preferences live in readable JSON and text files (listed at the end), so you can back up, diff, or edit everything the app remembers.

## Subsystem by subsystem

### Process Monitor & network analytics
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Connection events | Sysmon — `EventLogWatcher` over the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` channel; the installer configures the manifest via `wevtutil` and can repair inconsistent installs |
| Packet counters | Raw-socket sniffer — `IOControlCode.ReceiveAll` (SIO_RCVALL) on raw IP sockets, one IPv4 plus a best-effort IPv6 socket; no WinPcap/Npcap dependency |
| Name resolution | Background reverse-DNS + org-label service — see **DNS & org resolution** below |
| Task attribution | taskhostw instance GUID on the command line correlated with Task Scheduler history (the channel is enabled once if off); COM-handler tasks get their ClassId resolved through `HKCR\CLSID\{…}\InprocServer32` to the handler DLL, flagged when unregistered |
| Live ordering | WPF `ICollectionView` live sorting on the row's `LastSeen` timestamp; stale rows detected off a UI timer |
| TX-only filter | Off-by-default view lens: `ICollectionView.Filter` + live filtering over a time-gated `IsTxOnly` flag (sent bytes > 0, received = 0, row ≥ 30 s old — the grace keeps mid-handshake rows from flashing, since rows seed at 0/0 and Rx only lands when a reply crosses the sniffer); the checkbox label carries the live count while the lens is off; a view lens only — ingestion, the CSV export and the AI-audit context all read the unfiltered source |
| Row lifecycle | `LastSeen` seeded from the Sysmon event's UTC time (one-shot connections still get a real timestamp); the UI timer marks rows "— exited" once their PID is gone, and a later Sysmon event re-attributes the row to a new PID on the same remote IP |

### DNS & org resolution (the Host column)

| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Hostnames | Reverse DNS with a persistent cache (24 h TTL); Sysmon-provided names are seeded directly |
| Org/geo labels | Cached **per /24 prefix** (14 d positive, 24 h negative) so one answer covers a whole rotating fleet block. Source cascade, cheapest first: in-app range classifier → non-routable ranges (answered, no lookup at all) → prefix cache → ip-api.com (throttled at the free tier's 45 req/min, backoff doubling to 5 min on 429/timeouts and resetting on success) → **RDAP registry fallback** (the same IANA-bootstrap-routed engine the Blocked tab uses — its own cache, its own pacing, zero cost to the ip-api budget) |
| Transient failures | Cache nothing — a wrong "unresolved" must not outlive the outage; once the backoff window clears, a later pass retries |
| Why an IP shows no name | Every Host cell carries the reason in its tooltip: local-by-design, resolving (with queue depth), throttled (with a retry estimate), negative-cached (with the retry time), or resolved (with when) |
| User control | Right-click → **Resolve now** (user-initiated: skips the inter-call spacing for that one lookup; cooldowns still apply), **⟳ Retry unresolved DNS** (forgets negative answers and raw-IP placeholders, resets the backoff, re-queues the view's unresolved rows at normal pacing), and the **idle reconciler** (see next row) |
| Idle reconciliation | Every placeholder answer is already persisted in the hostname cache, so "all unresolved IPs" falls out of it oldest-first. When the Sysmon feed has been quiet for 5 minutes (traffic idle — re-checked every minute), batches of 8 addresses are re-asked through the normal paced pipeline; 2-minute cooldown between batches; 5 attempts per address per session, then left until the entries age out (24 h). Fresh negative answers are never re-asked early. Wired to the watcher's `QuietFor` in the app; never runs in headless faces |
| Cache files | `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\dns_cache.json`, `geo_prefix_cache.json`, `dns_forward_cache.json` — machine-wide, so they survive install-folder moves (a legacy beside-the-exe cache is copied once on first run) |
| AI access | `lookup_ip` on the bridge reports the same cascade and state; `force: true` is the urgent path |

### Sysmon Audit
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Status facts | Service state via `sc query`, event-channel health and 24 h event counts via `wevtutil`/`Get-WinEvent`, active config hash from `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonDrv\Parameters` |
| Recommended config | Generated `sysmon_config.xml` capturing process creations (ID 1), network connections (ID 3) and DNS queries (ID 22); applied with `Sysmon64 -c` on existing installs |
| Install/repair | Download from `live.sysinternals.com`, `Sysmon64 -i -accepteula`; inconsistent-state repair removes stale manifest registrations (reboot + auto-retry when Windows holds the registration) |
| Process-creation feed | `EventLogWatcher` over `*[System[(EventID=1)]]` plus a time-bounded historical backfill reader |

### Update Control
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Discovery | Self-update `.old` leftovers, `*updat*` folders under the user profile, and "update" autostart Run keys; vendor shown via Authenticode signature |
| Freeze | ACL snapshot with `icacls /save`, then deny ACE `(DE,WD,AD)` for the current user on the exe, then verification that the deny is present; Windows-signed/system-path binaries refused |
| Thaw | `icacls /restore` of the snapshot; deny-ACE absence verified before state cleanup |
| State | `update_freeze.json` next to the exe; ACL backups under `freeze_backups\` |

### OneSettings cadence (🔄 tab + `OneSettingsCadence` CLI)

The 🔄 **OneSettings tab** and the standalone `OneSettingsCadence` CLI are two
faces over one engine (`OneSettingsCadence/OneSettingsCadence.Core`, linked
in-process by the app the same way `SvchostAnalyzer.Core` is — the CLI keeps
its own `Main()` and builds separately). It slows the Windows inbox task
`\Microsoft\Windows\Flighting\OneSettings\RefreshCache` — the OneSettings
remote-config fetch that runs ~20-40×/day as SYSTEM off a ~3h20m repetition
(+1h random delay, +WNF state-change triggers) — to a user-chosen interval, and
restores stock behavior afterwards. Task Scheduler is reached over the
`Schedule.Service` COM interface (same dynamic-COM pattern as
`Services/TaskSchedulerService.cs`), never through `schtasks.exe`. The app
manifest already demands administrator, so the tab applies changes with no UAC
round-trip; the CLI self-elevates.

| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| `status` / `preview` / `runs` | Read-only, no elevation (the task's security descriptor grants Authenticated Users read). `preview` runs the exact transform `set` would apply and prints the resulting task XML; `runs` (also the tab's third card) reads the Task Scheduler operational channel and compares observed launches against the expected cadence — each launch bucketed by why the scheduler says it fired (timer / event / logon / manual-API). WNF state-change triggers fire through the same EID-107 channel as the timer, so the verdict is WNF-aware: excess 107s with WNF triggers installed are theirs, not a reverted cadence |
| `set` | Self-elevates via UAC (the elevated child tees its output back to the caller's console through a temp file); writes a timestamped backup of the live XML under `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\onesettings-cadence\backups\` (UTF-16, round-trip-verified), re-registers, then re-reads the live task and compares interval / random delay / WNF trigger count — any mismatch rolls back from the backup (a failed rollback exits 4 and says so loudly) |
| The transform | Touches `Triggers` only: repetition interval set, `RandomDelay` forced to `PT0S`, `WnfStateChangeTrigger` elements removed unless `--keep-wnf`. A repetition `Duration` shorter than the new interval is dropped (absent = indefinite) so the pattern cannot re-arm on the boundary. Principal (S-1-5-18), actions, settings and `SecurityDescriptor` are preserved from the live XML |
| Watchdog | Optional (`set --watchdog`, or the tab's checkbox): a SYSTEM task `\AutoCommand\OneSettingsCadenceWatchdog` (daily 03:30 + logon) re-applies the saved cadence only when the live task drifted — Windows servicing rewrites inbox task definitions (this machine's `StartBoundary` was rewritten by the OS the day the tool was written). From the CLI the watchdog runs the exe with `enforce --quiet`; from the tab it launches AutoCommand.exe with the `onesettings-enforce` argument, handled headlessly in `App.OnStartup` before any window loads. `restore` removes the watchdog so it cannot fight the restored stock definition |
| `restore` | Re-registers the newest backup (or `--backup <file>`), with the same snapshot → register → verify → roll-back discipline; clears the saved cadence and removes the watchdog on success |
| Interval input | Plain hours (`24`, `24h`, `0.5`), clock (`06:00:00`, `6:00`), or ISO 8601 (`PT24H`, `P1DT12H`); default 24h; warns below 6h or above 72h (cached OneSettings payloads declare ~72h freshness windows) but proceeds |
| Audit | Every change (what, when, old→new interval/delay/WNF count, backup filename, user, result) is one JSONL line in `onesettings-cadence\audit.jsonl` |
| Exit codes | `0` ok · `1` usage/task-not-found/IO · `2` drift found (`status`) or verified failure rolled back · `3` elevation declined · `4` rollback failed too |

Pure logic (parser, transform, drift detection, run-history field parsing and
compliance bucketing — including the exact-match event namespace a typo once
silently broke) has an offline self-test: `OneSettingsCadenceSelfTest`
(43 checks, no COM, no writes, no elevation).

| Live external starts | While the tab is open, an `EventLogWatcher` over the scheduler channel flags launches that fired with no trigger event (100 without 107/108/119 — something called `Run()`), confirmed on a 3 s deadline so out-of-order trigger events do not false-alarm; EID 129 supplies the taskhostw PID, Sysmon EID 3/5 join the fetch destinations and exit (pure correlator unit-covered; degrades to starts-without-evidence when Sysmon is absent) |

What the tab cannot enforce, honestly stated in the card itself: the watchdog
re-asserts the task *definition*; launches started by other actors (`Run()` on
the task) are counted and named but not preventable, and a component that
bypasses the task entirely (fetching OneSettings in-process from a service) is
invisible to scheduler history — it would surface as svchost traffic in the
Process Monitor, where it can be blocked like any other destination.

### Telemetry Opt-Out
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Knowledge base | `Assets\telemetry_rules.json` (detection, state probe, opt-out, revert per app); built-in seed fallback |
| Probes/appliers | JSON key read/write, user environment variables, HKLM policy values (DWORD or string) |
| Reversibility | Previous value snapshotted to `telemetry_state.json` before each change; Revert restores it (or deletes an added value) |
| Verification | `Get-DnsClientCache` checked for each app's known telemetry domains |

### Advanced Firewall
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Rule engine | `INetFwPolicy2` COM (`HNetCfg.FwPolicy2`) — enumerate, enable/disable, create block rules |
| Group names | Indirect strings (`@FirewallAPI.dll,-32752`) resolved via `SHLoadIndirectString` (`shlwapi.dll`) |
| Profiles & drift | Baseline of every rule's enabled state stored as JSON in `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand`; re-scanned to report drift |
| 1-click blocks | Inbound + outbound rules per executable or remote address, created over the same COM interface |

### Security Enforcer
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Device events | WMI `__InstanceCreationEvent` / `__InstanceDeletionEvent` / `__InstanceModificationEvent` subscriptions on `Win32_NetworkAdapter` — zero polling idle cost |
| SSTP guard | Service state via the Service Controller; re-asserts stopped + disabled (`Start=4`) in a reconciliation sweep |
| Kernel-debug block | `bcdedit` state reads/writes plus KDNIC adapter removal |
| Adapter removal | `SetupAPI` P/Invoke (`setupapi.dll`) in `WanMiniportRemover.cs` — kernel-mode clean device removal, no `pnputil` |
| Logon task | `schtasks /create … /rl highest` via the shared runner |
| Alerts | Windows toast notifications (`Windows.UI.Notifications`) |

### Default Apps & Bloatware
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| App inventory | `Windows.Management.Deployment.PackageManager` (`FindPackagesForUser`) — frameworks, resource packages, and System-signed components filtered to match Settings → Installed apps |
| Signature status | `Package.SignatureKind`, validated by the deployment engine at install time (Store / Enterprise / System / Developer / Unsigned) |
| Uninstall | `PackageManager.RemovePackageAsync` per package full name |
| OneDrive (Win32) | Not a Store package — detected via install directory + `UninstallString` registry entry (HKCU/HKLM), removed with `OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall`, `winget` fallback |
| Your custom list | Delta config (opt-outs + additions) in `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\bloatware_config.json`, merged over the compiled-in defaults by `BloatwareConfig` |

### UEFI & Secure Boot
| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| EFI baseline | SHA256 hash of every `.efi` module on the EFI System Partition; drift reported against a stored baseline |
| Boot manager check | Sysinternals `sigcheck64.exe` — downloaded only after SHA256 + Authenticode (`wintrust.dll` `WinVerifyTrust`) gates; its UTF-16LE redirected output is decoded before parsing |
| DBX updates | `DBXUpdate.bin` downloaded from Microsoft's secureboot_objects repository, `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST` parsed in C#, applied with `Set-SecureBootUEFI` after explicit confirmation |

### AI Assistant

> Removed in v2026.10.12 — the audit/insight feature is being rethought. The per-tab state serialization it used (`IAiAuditable.GetAuditContext()` in every view) is intentionally kept in the codebase as the foundation for whatever replaces it.

### Platform
* **.NET 10 (WPF)** front end.
* **README infographics** are generated by `Assets/generate_infographics.py` (Python + matplotlib).

## What the app writes on your disk

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\bloatware_config.json` | Your bloatware-list customizations (delta over defaults) |
| `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\firewall_config.json` | Per-rule firewall overrides |
| `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\firewall_baseline.json` | Firewall drift baseline |

| `C:\ProgramData\AutoCommand\dns_cache.json` + `geo_prefix_cache.json` + `dns_forward_cache.json` | Hostname, org-prefix and forward-DNS caches (machine-wide; a legacy beside-the-exe copy is migrated on first run). Forward cache: 60 min TTL, 10 min negative TTL |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\pytrace\` | Python Spawns tab state — see below |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\bits\` | BITS Transfers tab state — see below |

### BITS Transfers tab (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\bits\`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jobs.jsonl` | One line per completed BITS job, appended at completion: full metadata (job GUID, creator process + PID, owner account, direction, URL/host/port, resolved IPs, destination owner org, bytes, status, verdict, reason, per-file remote/local names + size + SHA-256). Never file content. |
| `bits-stats.json` | Per-(creator → host) transfer rollups (counts, upload counts, per-day buckets, first/last seen); flushed at most once a minute when dirty |

Both are plain, readable files. The tab reads Windows' own `Microsoft-Windows-Bits-Client/Operational` event log and enumerates the BITS COM queue read-only (all users, via the elevation the app already has); it never creates, cancels or modifies jobs. File content is read only by the explicit per-file preview window, in memory, and never written anywhere.

### Python Spawns tab (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\pytrace\`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trace-<pid>.jsonl` | Audit-hook records from instrumented pythons (written by the hook, tailed + cleaned up by the app) |
| `sslkeys.log` (+ `.old` while rotating) | TLS session keys written by instrumented pythons via `SSLKEYLOGFILE`; created with a current-user-only ACL, rotated at 5 MB, `.old` deleted at app exit |
| `no-keylog` | Flag file: the "Disable TLS keylogging" toggle — its presence makes the hook stop setting `SSLKEYLOGFILE` |
| `instrumented.json` | Manifest of python environments the audit hook was installed into (and the exact files written) |
| `env_scan.json` | Instrumentation discovery state: user-added scan roots, environments deliberately forgotten, last deep-scan time |
| `settings.json` | Tab settings (keylog toggle state, flow persistence, flow caps) |
| `flows\*.jsonl` | Optional persisted TCP flows (base64 payloads, off by default, rotated by budget) |

Outside that directory the tab only **reads**: the Sysmon operational channel (EID 1/5/3) and raw packets from the NIC on its own socket. The instrumentation itself is opt-in per python environment: two small files (`PyTraceHook_ac.py` + `.pth`) written into that environment's site-packages, tracked in the manifest, removable from the Instrument dialog. Nothing inside a venv is ever read for correlation; the interpreter binary is never touched.

### Why is this site slow? (🩺 tab)

Born from a real diagnosis (a site whose refreshes stalled for seconds): the archive said "zero server bytes everywhere," which was almost misread as "replies are blocked" until a control disproved it. The tab automates the corrected method — three engines, verdicts that never outrun their evidence.

* **`SiteFingerprintService`** — passive: groups the Transmissions archive by SNI and reads edge dispersion (4+ server addresses where this machine's own median is 1–2), 5-second connection bursts (browser racing retries), and single-edge churn. Signals are evidence lines, never conclusions; the archive only keeps >10 KB or decrypted conversations, so counts are a sample.
* **`SiteProbeService`** — active, hard-capped in code (~21 operations): 5 DNS resolves of the same name (rotation = short-TTL steering), per-edge TCP timing plus **two TLS hello shapes** (Windows-default vs plain TLS 1.2-only — a server that answers one and drops the other is the "works in one app, hangs in another" signature), and control-host handshakes so "your line is fine" is measured. Every operation lands verbatim in the report's log; certificates are not validated (transport behavior is measured, no credentials flow, nothing is changed).
* **`SiteVerdictService`** — rules in priority order: Blocked → LocalTlsBroken (every handshake fails *including controls* — the local stack, a real post-hardening condition) → HandshakeDropping → Steering → FarAway → Healthy (with an honest "fast now, but history shows bursts" split). Each verdict ships evidence lines and one reversible next step; nothing is auto-applied.

Read-only `diagnose_site` on the agent bridge runs the same pipeline (~30 s, DNS sampling tightened to 3 s). `SiteDoctorSelfTest\` compiles the shipping sources and proves: all fingerprint signals, every verdict rule, live loopback detection of the black-hole handshake shape (a listener that accepts TCP and never answers), and the caps. One SKIP is by design: a machine whose schannel cannot host TLS ("platform does not support ephemeral keys", observed after OS hardening) cannot run the healthy-server half — it says so loudly and still validates the rest.

Related capture-honesty fix in the same work: `TcpStreamCaptureService` now requests `SIO_RCVALL_IPLEVEL` first (both directions at the IP layer, no NIC promiscuous dependency) with `RCVALL_ON` fallback, tallies inbound vs outbound packets per session, and the Transmissions tab shows a banner when the session is one-way — a 0 in Down then reads "not observed", not "nothing came back".

The app collects **no usage telemetry** — nothing in it sends data anywhere on its own. (Usage analytics via Firebase/GA4 have been removed; the "Telemetry Opt-Out" section above is the Windows-telemetry hardening feature, unrelated.)

### Process Investigation (🔬 tab + `investigate_process` tool)

One composite read-only investigation per run — the whole "why is this transmitting?" playbook in a single call, joining facts the individual surfaces already record rather than collecting anything new:

* **`ProcessInvestigationService`** (Forensics core) — orchestrates `ProcessProvenanceService` (PID inquiry incl. the PID-reuse guard; enabled when a PID is given, best-effort on a live instance when a name is given), `TraceMetricsService` (the Traces-card traffic profile: frequency, destinations with classification, beacon regularity, recorded TLS volume, live connections), and the block-hit feed's **in-memory cache** (`Aggregates` — deliberately never the live Sysmon join, which is the slow path). Verdicts describe the numbers without claiming a baseline: Quiet → Internal-only → Outbound attempts, none completed → Actively blocked → Mixed, in priority order, each with evidence lines. Default window 6 h (cap 24) — the full-day archive scan is the slow path.
* **`InvestigateView`** (🔬 tab, SYSTEM group, opt-in via Settings → Advanced investigation) — Site-Doctor-shaped: subject box (name or PID), lookback picker, colored verdict banner, monospace report with Copy and Save (markdown under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\reports\`).
* **`investigate_process`** on the agent bridge runs the same service and returns the structured JSON plus the identical `report_text`.

## MCP server (AgentProxy)

The "autocommand" MCP server AI clients connect to is **two halves**:

1. **`AutoCommand.AgentProxy.exe`** — the process clients actually spawn. A tiny asInvoker console exe (no WPF, no admin, no UAC) that reads `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\agent\session.json` (port + bearer token, present only while an AI session is active) on every incoming message and forwards each stdin JSON-RPC line to `127.0.0.1:<port>`. With no session it completes the MCP handshake itself ("offline" mode) and answers every tool call with setup guidance, so a client connects cleanly at any time.
2. **`AgentBridgeService`** — the listener inside the running (elevated) app: raw `TcpListener` on loopback, one minimal HTTP/1.1 request per connection, constant-time bearer-token compare, DNS-rebinding Host check, dispatch through `AgentToolRegistry`.

### Startup prerequisites (the DOTNET_ROOT trap)

Desktop MCP clients (Electron apps especially) routinely bundle their own .NET and export `DOTNET_ROOT` for every child they spawn — sometimes a runtime **older** than the one a framework-dependent apphost needs. The apphost then never falls back to the machine-wide install and exits before any managed code runs: the client just shows "server failed to start", with nothing actionable. For that reason the proxy ships as a **self-contained single-file exe** (runtime bundled, ~15 MB IL-trimmed; `release.ps1` publishes it into the zip's `tools\AgentProxy\`). It performs no framework lookup at all, so a hostile `DOTNET_ROOT` cannot break it.

The app's Register action installs that exe into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\tools\v<version>\` (a fresh folder per app version — so a version bump always refreshes the deployed bits and a proxy still running from an older folder never locks the copy) and **preflights** it before any client config points at it: the exe must answer an MCP handshake both normally and under a poisoned `DOTNET_ROOT`, or registration refuses to claim success.

### Protocol

Supported `protocolVersion` values (both halves, kept identical): **2024-11-05, 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18**. A supported version is echoed; anything else is answered with the newest supported one (never blind-echoed — echoing "1999-01-01" used to claim a protocol we do not speak). Requests other than `initialize`/`ping` before initialization are refused with `-32002`; `resources/*` and `prompts/*` answer `-32601` (honestly unimplemented). Forwarding failures when the app session goes away answer `-32603` with guidance text. `serverInfo` is identical offline and online (`autocommand` / "AutoCommand (agent bridge)" / app version) so client UIs never relabel the server when a session flips mid-connection.

### Offline vs online

The proxy re-reads `session.json` on every message, so a session started after the client connected takes effect on the next call. The state flip emits exactly one `notifications/tools/list_changed` — only after the response to the in-flight message and only for clients that completed initialization. Proxy lifetimes (spawn parent, client name, stop reason) are appended to the same `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutoCommand\agent\activity.jsonl` the app writes; stdout stays JSON-RPC only. A parent-PID watchdog plus stdin EOF guarantee the proxy never outlives its client.

### Testing by hand

```powershell
# full suite: publishes the self-contained proxy like release.ps1, then drives
# offline/online/flip/restart/error-code/poisoned-DOTNET_ROOT cases
powershell -File test-agent-proxy.ps1

# install-decision logic (versioned refresh, locked files, fallbacks)
dotnet run --project ProxyInstallSelfTest

# bridge end-to-end (starts the elevated app headless - UAC prompt)
powershell -File test-agent-bridge.ps1

# one manual handshake against the deployed copy
$exe = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AutoCommand\tools\AutoCommand.AgentProxy.exe"
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","clientInfo":{"name":"hand-test","version":"0"}}}',
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}',
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}' | & $exe
```
